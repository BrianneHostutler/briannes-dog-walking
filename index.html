                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Brianne’s Dog Walking provides pet services such as dog walking and drop in visits in Windermere, FL and the surrounding area. I can walk your dog during those busy days when you might not have enough time to fit in a nice walk for your dog. I can also jog or run with your dog if they have a lot of energy or like to run! If your dog is being trained to walk in a particular way ( for instance if they’re learning ‘heel’ or loose leash walking ) I can reinforce that training while walking your dog. </p>
                    <p>If you have more than one dog, I can walk up to three dogs at a time (depending on their size and how well they walk as a group). I generally do walks in the mornings and evenings on both weekdays and weekends. I provide services mainly to the Windermere & Winter Garden regions, but I also do visits to the Walt Disney World resorts and some of the surrounding area. Please contact me if you have any questions about whether I come to your area!</p>
